# Document-Search-Python-
This project involves building a Python application program, called DocSearch.py, that implements document searching based on vector-based document matching and inverted index. The input involves two text files, docs.txt (containing all the documents in the corpus) and queries.txt (containing all the queries). The output involves printing messages in a specific format, including the number of unique words in the dictionary, the relevant documents that contain all the words in the query, and the angle (in degrees) between the search query and each document. The program will be automatically tested on a large set of test conditions, and marks will be assigned based on specific criteria, including the building of the dictionary, building and querying the inverted index, working out angles, and efficiency.
